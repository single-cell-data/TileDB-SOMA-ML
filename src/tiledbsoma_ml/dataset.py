class ExperimentDataset(IterableDataset[Batch]):  # type:ignore[misc]
    """A :class:`torch.utils.data.IterableDataset` implementation that loads from a :class:`tiledbsoma.SOMAExperiment`.

    This class works seamlessly with :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to load ``obs`` and ``X`` data as
    specified by a SOMA :class:`tiledbsoma.ExperimentAxisQuery`, providing an iterator over batches of
    ``obs`` and ``X`` data. Each iteration will yield a tuple containing an :class:`numpy.ndarray`
    and a :class:`pandas.DataFrame`.

    For example:

    >>> import torch
    >>> import tiledbsoma
    >>> import tiledbsoma_ml
    >>> with tiledbsoma.Experiment.open("my_experiment_path") as exp:
    ...     with exp.axis_query(measurement_name="RNA", obs_query=tiledbsoma.AxisQuery(value_filter="tissue_type=='lung'")) as query:
    ...         ds = tiledbsoma_ml.ExperimentDataset(query)
    ...         dataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(ds)
    >>> data = next(iter(dataloader))
    >>> data
    (array([0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32),
    soma_joinid
    0     57905025)
    >>> data[0]
    array([0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 0., 0.], dtype=float32)
    >>> data[1]
    soma_joinid
    0     57905025

    The ``batch_size`` parameter controls the number of rows of ``obs`` and ``X`` data that are returned in each
    iteration. If the ``batch_size`` is 1, then each result will have rank 1, else it will have rank 2. A ``batch_size``
    of 1 is compatible with :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`-implemented batching, but it will usually be more
    performant to create mini-batches using this class, and set the ``DataLoader`` batch size to `None`.

    The ``obs_column_names`` parameter determines the data columns that are returned in the ``obs`` DataFrame (the
    default is a single column, containing the ``soma_joinid`` for the ``obs`` dimension).

    The ``io_batch_size`` parameter determines the number of rows read, from which mini-batches are yielded. A
    larger value will increase total memory usage and may reduce average read time per row.

    Shuffling support is enabled with the ``shuffle`` parameter, and will normally be more performant than using
    :class:`DataLoader` shuffling. The shuffling algorithm works as follows:

      1. Rows selected by the query are subdivided into groups of size ``shuffle_chunk_size``, aka a "shuffle chunk".
      2. A random selection of shuffle chunks is drawn and read as a single I/O buffer (of size ``io_buffer_size``).
      3. The entire I/O buffer is shuffled.

    Put another way, we read randomly selected groups of observations from across all query results, concatenate
    those into an I/O buffer, and shuffle the buffer before returning mini-batches. The randomness of the shuffle
    is therefore determined by the ``io_buffer_size`` (number of rows read), and the ``shuffle_chunk_size``
    (number of rows in each draw). Decreasing ``shuffle_chunk_size`` will increase shuffling randomness, and decrease I/O
    performance.

    This class will detect when run in a multiprocessing mode, including multi-worker :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`
    and multi-process training such as :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, and will automatically partition
    data appropriately. In the case of distributed training, sample partitions across all processes must be equal. Any
    data tail will be dropped.

        Construct a new ``Experiment``, suitable for use with :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.

        The resulting iterator will produce a tuple containing associated slices of ``X`` and ``obs`` data, as
        a NumPy :class:`numpy.ndarray` (or optionally, :class:`scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`) and a Pandas
        :class:`pandas.DataFrame`, respectively.

        Args:
            query:
                A :class:`tiledbsoma.ExperimentAxisQuery`, defining the data to iterate over.
            layer_name:
                The name of the X layer to read.
            obs_column_names:
                The names of the ``obs`` columns to return. At least one column name must be specified.
                Default is ``('soma_joinid',)``.
            batch_size:
                The number of rows of ``X`` and ``obs`` data to return in each iteration. Defaults to ``1``. A value of
                ``1`` will result in :class:`torch.Tensor` of rank 1 being returned (a single row); larger values will
                result in :class:`torch.Tensor`s of rank 2 (multiple rows). Note that a ``batch_size`` of 1 allows
                this ``IterableDataset`` to be used with :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader` batching, but higher
                performance can be achieved by performing batching in this class, and setting the ``DataLoader``'s
                ``batch_size`` parameter to ``None``.
            io_batch_size:
                The number of ``obs``/``X`` rows to retrieve when reading data from SOMA. This impacts:
                1. Maximum memory utilization, larger values provide better read performance, but require more memory.
                2. The number of rows read prior to shuffling (see the ``shuffle`` parameter for details).
                The default value of 65,536 provides high performance but may need to be reduced in memory-limited hosts
                or when using a large number of :class:`DataLoader` workers.
            shuffle:
                Whether to shuffle the ``obs`` and ``X`` data being returned. Defaults to ``True``.
            shuffle_chunk_size:
                The number of contiguous rows sampled prior to concatenation and shuffling.
                Larger numbers correspond to less randomness, but greater read performance.
                If ``shuffle == False``, this parameter is ignored.
            seed:
                The random seed used for shuffling. Defaults to ``None`` (no seed). This argument *MUST* be specified
                when using :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` to ensure data partitions are disjoint
                across worker processes.
            return_sparse_X:
                If ``True``, will return the ``X`` data as a :class:`scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`. If ``False`` (the
                default), will return ``X`` data as a :class:`numpy.ndarray`.
            use_eager_fetch:
                Fetch the next SOMA chunk of ``obs`` and ``X`` data immediately after a previously fetched SOMA chunk is
                made available for processing via the iterator. This allows network (or filesystem) requests to be made
                in parallel with client-side processing of the SOMA data, potentially improving overall performance at
                the cost of doubling memory utilization. Defaults to ``True``.

        Raises:
            ``ValueError`` on various unsupported or malformed parameter values.
